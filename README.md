##### Download instagram photos easily (and without screenshoting)

This WebExtension is submitted for review and will hopefully be published soon, but you can download this code and play around with it yourself. Basically, it downloads the instagram photo that you've currently opened - because we all know that it's a bit of hassle to download a photo from instagram (and not screenshoting it).

Instructions on how to run this extension in debug mode can be [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cer9EUKegG4)
